To see my work, please 

1) clone the directory.

2) Update the server.py with your own username and password.
        Create using mongodb atlas two collections under the 'test' db. 
        Colection # 1 : Patients
        Collection # 2 : Doctors 
        Run python server.py to run the backend server

3) Run npm start or ng serve in the terminal. 
        Next navigate `http://localhost:4200/`
